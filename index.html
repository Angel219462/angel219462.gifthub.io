<!-- Hello my name is Angel and i'm majoring in Web Development. I have a lot of interest and likes but here are five--
of them. I love playing videos games from first person shooter games to open world like minecraft. I've been playing
soccer since I was 6 years old and have loved it ever since, my dad got me into it. Thridly I enjoy combat sports wether--
that be grappling or striking, my parents got me into kickboxing when I was in seventh grade and still do it to this day
and have competed three times. My favorite weather is fall weather just because it's not too cold like winter nor hot--
like the summer and I HATE the heat. Lastly im a big fan of superheroes and comics, I have a pretty big collection of 
comic books in my room.-->
